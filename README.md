# Udacity: Intro To Self Driving Cars

### C++ Basics and Performance Programming

This module was the first step in a rewarding journey towards C++ expertise. By comparing programs previously written in Python to C++, the performance benefits became strikingly obvious. We also explored how to write good code that runs correctly. We focused primarily on low level features of C++, but discussed other best practices as well.

## Project Description:

The goal of this project was to take my  **python**  code I wrote when you  I implemented the two dimensional histogram filter and translate it into  **C++**.

I can evaluate the correctness of my code by compiling  `tests.cpp`  and then running the output. Do this by running the following from the command line.

```
g++ -std=c++11 tests.cpp
./a.out
```

### Program output

```
! - normalize function worked correctly!

! - blur function worked correctly!
! - initialize_beliefs function worked correctly!

! - move function worked correctly with zero blurring

! - sense function worked correctly
```
